What is Babel in React JS?
Babel is a transpiler i.e. it converts the JSX to vanilla JavaScript. 
You can view babel as an intermediate step between your code and 
"executable" code. React also uses ES6, which is not supported by 
most of the browsers. Babel converts the ES6 code to a code which is 
compatible with the browsers

The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesn't have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM.
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation. ... They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React.
